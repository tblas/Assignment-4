I am not able to use the android emulator so I only had mobile web browser. I like how your text is large on both pages. 
The image of your resume on the child page was a good idea so you don't have to list things and enables the viewer to see more 
about you and your experiences rather than just a few words. I would maybe change the font size on the second page to take up more 
screen real estate since it is just a snippet about you and then the image.
